While I do not intend for this repo to become a link dump, there are a few books and articles I'd consider to be recommended or required reading for engineering managers.

Disclosure: Amazon links may have an affiliate tag. I'd like to donate whatever small pittances may come through this repo to a charity, perhaps [Hope for the Day](https://www.hftd.org/) and/or [OSMI](https://osmihelp.org/).
