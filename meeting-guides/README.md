# Meeting Guides

The purpose of Meeting Guides is to provide a simple framework for you to define, refine and/or revisit the purpose of your meetings. They're simply meant to answer a few basic questions:

- What is the purpose of this meeting?
- Are the meetings I'm having accomplishing that purpose?
- What changes can we make to improve them - even if it means eliminating the meeting?
