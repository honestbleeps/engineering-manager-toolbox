Team Standup

Purpose:
- Create a shared understanding of task/project/sprint statuses
- Provide a regular opportunity for teammates to make each other aware of blockers, ask for / offer help, etc.
- Ensure that the team understands what work is most important to tackle next
	+ Based on the board, where should engineers spend their time (i.e. is code review or deployment more important than writing code right now?)
	+ Which tasks/tickets should be taken next?

Agenda:
- Review daily status (usually a board or task list of some sort)
- Parking lot
- Summarize and send out action items
